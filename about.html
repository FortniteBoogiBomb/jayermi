        <h2>About Page</h2>
        <p> Hi there! I'm Jay I am 23 years old and just graduated from Indiana University</p>
        <p>I have a Bacholer of Science in Intellegent Systems Engineering, with a concentration in Computer Engineering</p>
        <p>I have been programming with C & Python for 4+ years, and I have extensive experience with MATLAB and microcontrollers  </p>
        <p>I have experience with many other languages and embedded systems, as well as robotics and drones</p>

        <h2>Capstone</h2>
        <p>One of the more signifigant projects that I have worked on as an Engineer was my desnior design capstone project</p>
        <p>Our prototype was called the EMG controlled exo-skeltal arm brace </p>
        <img src="images/IMG_2949%20(1).jpg" alt="Picture of brace hardware, I designed and assembled this hardware prototype myself" class="my-image">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>During my Junior year I took two classes, (one first semester and one second semester)</p>
        <p>Taught by Dr. Greg Lewis. After taking both of these classes which I thoroughly enjoyed </p>
        <p>I approached Dr. lewis and asked if he needed any help in his lab. He was very excited that I asked and quickly got me involved</p>
        <p>During my time in the lab I primarily worked on two studies. The first one I worked on </p>
        <p>was called Trusting Ai or Trust In Ai (depending on who you ask.) This project is funded by NSA Crane and is still active in the lab. </p>
        <p>The main thing I contributed to this project was related to one particular study. "Hapty Bird" </p>
        <p>This study involved one outside subject and one lab member. The subject and the lab member were instructed to either </p>
        <p>play cooperativley to achieve a high score, or play against each other to achieve a high score. The cool part about this game,</p>
        <p>is that if you don't work together, you will almost always lose more money than you would working together. The game consisted</p>
        <p>of two haptic controllers in seperate rooms. Each controller controlled its own agent, but each of the two agents were tethered together.</p>
        <p>The two players were also provided with a camera to visually comunicate with the other player, but they were physically prevented from speaking to each other verbally</p>
        <p>They could only use hand gestures, emotions, and lip reading to communicate. The goal of the game is simple: make money (perhaps more than your partner.)  </p>
        <p>The participants were also told (lied to) that the money they made would be converted into real money (in gift cards) purchased by the lab. </p>
        <p>Once the game started the participants were shown the two agents, and the tehter connecting them. When one player moved their haptic feedback controller up, the other player could physically feel the pull from the agent on their hand.</p>
        <p>To make things even spicier, the gates that were shown to each player were positioned similar to flappy bird (except there are two gates you could pass through)</p>
        <p>One gate would have a net income of money while the other would have a net loss of money. however, failing to pass through either of the gates would have a huge impact on your money</p>
        <p>So players were forced to play, knowing that the "opponent" would see a chance to gain more money or chose to cooperate and potenially lose money. However if each player were to pull to the opposing gate...they would both lose a ton of money (or all of it)</p>
        <p> More info to come. </p>
