        <h2>About Page</h2>
        <p> Hi there! I'm Jay I am 23 years old and just graduated from Indiana University</p>
        <p>I have a Bacholer of Science in Intellegent Systems Engineering, with a concentration in Computer Engineering</p>
        <p>I have been programming with C & Python for 4+ years, and I have extensive experience with MATLAB and microcontrollers  </p>
        <p>I have experience with many other languages and embedded systems, as well as robotics and drones</p>

            <h2>Capstone</h2>
        <p>One of the more signifigant projects that I have worked on as an Engineer was my senior design capstone project</p>
        <p>Our prototype was called the EMG controlled exo-skeltal arm brace and was sponsored by VispalExo </p>
        <p>An arduino microcontroller controls the logic of the brace using a support vector machine learning algorithim.</p>
        <p> The SVM classifier is able to read the emg signal and determine whether the user is flecing or extending the attatched muscle. </p>

        <h2>Undergraduate research</h2><img src="images/trusted.jpg" alt="Trusted Ai Symposium Photo"/>
        <p>During my time in the lab I primarily worked on two studies. The first one I worked on </p>
        <p>was called Trusted Ai or Trust In Ai (depending on who you ask.) This project is funded by NSA Crane and is still active in the socio-physio lab. </p>
        <p>This study involved one outside subject and one lab member. The subject and the lab member were instructed to either </p>
        <p>play cooperativley to achieve a high score, or play against each other to achieve a high score. The cool part about this game,</p>
        <p>is that if you don't work together, you will almost always lose more money than you would working together. The game consisted</p>
        <p>of two haptic controllers in seperate rooms. Each controller controlled its own agent, but each of the two agents were tethered together.</p>
        <p>The two players were also provided with a camera to visually comunicate with the other player, but they were physically prevented from speaking to each other verbally</p>
        <p>Once the game started the participants were shown the two agents, & the tehter connecting them. When one player moved their haptic feedback controller up,</p> 
        <p>the other player would feel the pull from the other agent on their hand.</p>
        <p>To make things even spicier, the gates that were shown to each player were positioned similar to flappy bird (except there are two gates you could pass through)</p>
        <p>One gate would have a net income of money while the other would have a net loss of money. however, failing to pass through either of the gates would have a huge impact on your money</p>
        <p>So players were forced to play, knowing that the "opponent" would see a chance to gain more money or chose to cooperate and potenially lose money. However if each player were to pull to the opposing gate...</p>
        <p>they would both lose a ton of money (or all of it)</p>
        <p>This study attempted to evaluate the trust between people and an autonomous agent. The study had some interesting findings, and one subject even got so mad they got up and left the lab!</p>
        <p>During the spring semester this year we presented some of the findings to the Department of Defense. We were able to show them the protocol and some of the visitors from Crane even got to play our game </p>
        <p>The main contribution I made towards this project, was with the haptic controller code, bug fixing the code for the "hapty-bird" game,</p>
        <p>running subjects through the protocol, and gathering/visualizing data collected on subjects to analyze results and findings</p>
        <p>Trusting Ai is sponsored by NSA Crane and is still currently accepting subjects</p>
